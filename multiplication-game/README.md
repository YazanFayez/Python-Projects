## 🧮 Math Practice Quizzer (`multiplication_game.py`)
A terminal-based multiplication game using Python's `random` module. This script was built for elementary school students in order to sharpen their math multiplication skills. 

**Features:**
* Generates random positive one-digit integers for dynamic questions.
* Uses a `while` loop to trap the user until they calculate the correct answer.
* Includes a replay feature so the user can keep playing without restarting the script.

**How to run it:**
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   `python multiplication_game.py`
